            <h3>Sarah's Journey</h3>
            <p>"I never thought I would be able to leave. The fear was overwhelming, but with the help of the hotline counselors and a local shelter, I found the strength to take that first step. It's been two years now, and while healing isn't linear, I'm building a life filled with peace and safety."</p>

            <h3>Finding My Voice</h3>
            <p>"The emotional abuse was invisible to everyone else, but it was destroying me from the inside. Learning about the cycle of abuse helped me understand that it wasn't my fault. The support group became my lifeline, and now I help other survivors find their voice too."</p>

            <h3>A New Beginning</h3>
            <p>"With two young children, I felt trapped and scared about what would happen if I left. The safety planning helped me prepare step by step. The legal advocates helped me understand my rights. Today, my children and I are safe, and they're seeing what a healthy relationship looks like."</p>

            <h3>Breaking the Silence</h3>
            <p>"I was ashamed and thought no one would believe me. The first time I called the hotline, I hung up. The second time, I stayed on the line. That conversation changed my life. The counselor believed me, supported me, and helped me see that I deserved better."</p>

            <h3>Rebuilding After Years</h3>
            <blockquote>"After twenty years in a controlling marriage, I felt like I had lost my identity. The shelter staff helped me rediscover who I was outside of the abuse. I went back to school at 45, and now I’m working in a career I love. It’s never too late to start again."</blockquote>

            <h3>From Fear to Confidence</h3>
            <blockquote>"As a man, I thought no one would understand what I was going through. Admitting I was being abused felt impossible. But the support group welcomed me without judgment. I’ve learned that strength comes from honesty, and today, I stand tall knowing I survived."</blockquote>
