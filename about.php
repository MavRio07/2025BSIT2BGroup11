        <h2>Our Impact</h2>
        <p>Since our founding, we have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provided crisis intervention services to thousands of survivors</li>
            <li>Helped hundreds of families find safe housing</li>
            <li>Supported survivors through legal proceedings and court advocacy</li>

            <li>Advocated for policy changes to better protect survivors</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Domestic violence affects people of all ages, backgrounds, and circumstances. It's not just physical abuse – it includes emotional, psychological, financial, and sexual abuse designed to maintain power and control over another person.</p>
        
        <p>The statistics are sobering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner physical violence</li>
            <li>1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have experienced some form of intimate partner violence</li>
            <li>On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States</li>
            <li>Domestic violence hotlines receive over 20,000 calls per day</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These numbers represent real people – mothers, fathers, children, siblings, friends, and community members who deserve safety, respect, and support.</p>
